## bug.n â€“ Tiling Window Management

bug.n is a [tiling window management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) 
add-on for the Explorer shell of Microsoft Windows. It is written in the scripting language 
[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

bug.n x.min is a minimal version of bug.n v10, which i.a. does not contain the following features:

* App calls (support for external apps)
* Custom or web interfaces
* Custom work areas
* dwm or i3wm layouts
* Dynamic (automatic) tiling
* Mouse-controlled
* Shell hook
* System status information
* (currently) Configuration templates (dwm, i3wm or xmonad)

Instead of dynamic tiling (reacting to closing and opening windows) and defined layouts 
bug.n x.min arranges the other windows in a group around the one, which is set to one of 
many defined positions. With the number of source files reduced, the directory structure 
is compressed.
